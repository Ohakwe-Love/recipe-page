## Overview

### The Challenge

Build a static recipe page using only HTML and CSS, based on the design provided by Frontend Mentor. The goal was to:
- Write clean, semantic HTML structure
- Use CSS to style headings, paragraphs, images, and lists
- Practice layout techniques like Flexbox
- Ensure the page is mobile-responsive

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I practiced:
- Structuring a page with semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`
- Styling list items and headings for better readability
- Applying consistent spacing and font styling
- Using Flexbox to align content and make the layout responsive

Example code snippet:

```html
<section class="instructions">
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.</li>
    <li>Mix flour and sugar in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Bake for 25 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
</section>
```

```css
.instructions {
  background-color: #fefcf9;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
```
